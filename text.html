    <h3>Self-driving car technology - The prospect of the automation industry in the future</h3>
    <p>Self-driving car technology is growing and becoming more prevalent as the market demands breakthroughs to usher in a new era for the automation industry.</p>
    <h3>History of self-driving car technology</h3>
    <p>- In 1939, during the General Motors show, Norman Bel Geddes created the first self-driving car. It was a radio-controlled electromagnetic vehicle made up of magnetized metal spikes mounted on the road. <br>

        - In 1977, Japan improved on this idea by using a camera system that transferred data to a computer to process images of the road. <br>
        However, this car can only move at a speed of about 32km / h. 
        After a decade, the Germans continue to produce a vehicle equipped with a camera that can drive itself at a speed of about 90km / h. <br>
        As this technology improves, so does the ability of self-driving cars to detect and respond to the environment. <br>
        
        - From 1950 - 2000, safety/convenience features, cruise control seat belts and Antilock Brakes were explored. <br>
        
        - In the year 2000-2010, the features of automation, cruise control, blind spot detection, collision warning, lane departure and anti-lock braking continued to be developed. These features are intended to ensure the safety and convenience of users. <br>
        
        - From 2010 to 2016, driver assistance capabilities such as rearview camera, automatic emergency braking and lane-focused assist appeared.
        - Since 2016 until now, the features of autonomous vehicles have gradually become more autonomous such as: helping the driver stay in the right lane, developing ACC technology (Adaptive Cruise Control - adaptive cruise control system) and self-parking capabilities.

    <h3>Working principle of self-driving car technology</h3>
    <div class="fade-in">

    <p>To apply self-driving car technology, developers have integrated AI technology to provide power, combining large amounts of data from image recognition systems, machine learning and neural networks. <br>
        The neural network will identify patterns in the data fed to the machine learning algorithm. <br>
        This data is usually images captured on self-driving cars so that the neural network learns to identify traffic lights, curbs, pedestrians, trees, signs, and other parts of the driving environment. 
        Cruise control system of self-driving car technology<br>
        The above technologies will combine with the features of autonomous vehicles available to operate such as: <br>
        
          - Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): When stopping, it automatically maintains the distance between the driver's car and the vehicle in front. <br>
        
          - Lane-focused steering feature: when the car crosses the road markings, this feature will intervene by automatically pushing the car towards the opposite lane. <br>
        
        - Free steering wheel: this feature allows the operator to not need to put their hands on the steering wheel. <br>
        
        The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) classifies different levels of self-driving cars to determine how autonomous the driver and vehicle are when operating.  <br>
        Specifically, there are six levels of self-driving cars from 0 to 5 and each level will represent different tasks and roles.</p>
